# Spot.IM Social Kit

The Spot.IM Social Kit consists of two components: Conversation and Popular in the Community. These components allow your users to write comments and view popular community-generated content.

If you are using WordPress, please see the [WordPress documentation page](../wordpress/README.md).

## Before You Begin

Before using the Spot.IM Social Kit, you will need your Spot.IM `Spot ID`. You will also need to create a `Post ID` for each article or page that you want to display the Social Kit on. You can use any alphanumeric value as a `Post ID`, but it must be unique to each page. See the following section for [best practices for creating Post IDs](#best-practices-for-creating-post-ids).

Additionally, your article pages will need to contain [OG Tags](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/open-graph-meta-tags/) tags. OG tags are meta tags that define the title, type, preview image, and other attributes of each article on your website. Each page must contain these tags in order for the Popular in the Community to generate previews of the article.

### Best Practices for Creating Post IDs

A Post ID can be any alphanumeric value that uniquely identifies a page. Post IDs can contain the following characters:

- Letters
- Numbers
- Underscores
- Dashes

Post IDs should be short. A common approach is to use the page's title or content. For example:

- `article_1`
- `article-title`
- `article-short-link`

## Standard Implementation

The Social Kit standard implementation adds two widgets to each page: the Conversation widget and the Popular in the Community widget. The Conversation widget lets your users view and create comments, while the Popular in the Community widget showcases popular user-generated content.

To add these widgets to your page, place the following elements in the location on the page where you want the widgets to appear. You can place these widgets anywhere, although we recommend placing them just below the page's main content.

You will need to replace the following placeholders:
- `SPOT_ID` - Your Spot ID. **Notice** that the `SPOT_ID` appears in 3 places.
- `POST_ID` in `data-post-id` attribute - A unique identifier for this Conversation.
- `ARTICLE_TOPIC` in `data-article-tags` attribute - This attribute is optional, and should include the main topics of the    article, to enable SpotIM's advanced features relating to Topic Pages, filtering Recirculation by Topic, etc.
- `ARTICLE_URL` in `data-post-url` attribute - The full Canonical URL of the page. This attribute is optional, assuming your wab page includes og tags or an attribute with the full canonical URL in the head.

```html
<div data-spotim-module="recirculation" data-spot-id="SPOT_ID"></div>
<script async src="https://recirculation.spot.im/spot/SPOT_ID"></script>
<script async src="https://launcher.spot.im/spot/SPOT_ID"
    data-spotim-module="spotim-launcher"
    data-post-url="ARTICLE_URL"
    data-article-tags="ARTICLE_TOPIC1, ARTICLE_TOPIC2"    
    data-post-id="POST_ID"></script>
```

## Other Options

### Standalone Conversation Widget

To display a Conversation widget by itself, place the Conversation's `<script>` element in the location on the page where you want the widget to appear. You can find an implementation example [here](conversation-example.html).

```html
<script async src="https://launcher.spot.im/spot/SPOT_ID"
    data-spotim-module="spotim-launcher"
    data-post-url="ARTICLE_URL"
    data-article-tags="ARTICLE_TOPIC1, ARTICLE_TOPIC2"    
    data-post-id="POST_ID"></script>
```

### Standalone Popular in the Community Widget

To display a Popular in the Community widget by itself, place the following elements in the location on the page where you want the widget to appear. You can find an implementation example [here](popular-in-the-community-example.html).

```html
<div data-spotim-module="recirculation" data-spot-id="SPOT_ID"></div>
<script src="https://recirculation.spot.im/spot/SPOT_ID"></script>
```

### Multiple Conversation Instances

You can embed multiple Conversation widgets on a single page. For more information, see the [Multiple Conversation Instances](../multiple-conversation-instances/README.md) documentation page.

### Displaying the Number of Messages in a Conversation

You can display a separate widget showing the number of messages in a Conversation. For more information, see the [Message Count](../comments-count/README.md) documentation page.

## Integrations

You can import comments from another comment platform into Spot.IM. If you are migrating from another platform, this lets your users continue their conversations in Spot.IM from the other platform.

The import process is triggered by an _import hint_, which is a set of parameters added to a Conversation's `<script>` block. These parameters identify the article in the platform you are importing from. When the Conversation loads for the first time, the import hint triggers the Spot.IM backend service to import the article's comments from the previous platform. This process occurs only once for each article when the article's Conversation widget is first loaded.

### Disqus

Importing comments from Disqus requires two additional attributes:

- `data-disqus-url` - [`disqus_url` or `this.page.url`](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472098-javascript-configuration-variables#thispageurl) parameter in your Disqus integration code.
- `data-disqus-identifier` - [`disqus_identifier`](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472099-what-is-a-disqus-identifier-) parameter in your Disqus integration code.

Add these parameters to the Conversation's `<script>` block on the article page.

```html
<script async src="https://launcher.spot.im/spot/SPOT_ID"
    data-spotim-module="spotim-launcher"
    data-post-id="POST_ID"
    data-article-tags="ARTICLE_TOPIC1, ARTICLE_TOPIC2"
    data-post-url="ARTICLE_URL"
    data-disqus-url="DISQUS_URL"
    data-disqus-identifier="DISQUS_IDENTIFIER"></script>
```

### Facebook

Importing comments from Facebook requires one additional attribute:

- `data-facebook-url` - this is the canonical URL of the page you place the Conversation on.

Add this parameter to the Conversation's `<script>` block on the article page.

```html
<script async src="https://launcher.spot.im/spot/SPOT_ID"
    data-spotim-module="spotim-launcher"
    data-post-id="POST_ID"
    data-article-tags="ARTICLE_TOPIC1, ARTICLE_TOPIC2"
    data-post-url="ARTICLE_URL"
    data-facebook-url="ARTICLE_URL"></script>
```

### Livefyre

Importing Livefyre comments requires one additional attributes:

- `data-livefyre-url` - this is the `articleId`, which uniquely identifies a Collection in your Livefyre account

See [Livefyre Import](../livefyre-import/README.md) documentation for more details about the import process.
